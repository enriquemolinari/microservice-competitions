# Competitions Microservice

This is the Competitions microservice of the RadioA sample application written as a demostration of the microservice architecture for the book [Coding an Architecture Style](https://leanpub.com/codinganarchitecturestyle). See also the others two microservices [Notifications Microservice](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/microservice-notifications) and [User Profile Microservice](https://github.com/enriquemolinari/microservice-userprofile) from the RadioA sample application.

 This book is completely free for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
